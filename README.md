# Flutter_projects
A record of my journey from beginner to (hopefully!) wizard of Flutter app development.
## Summary of each app:
* **01_Startup_namer** : App with a scroll-down interface for generating random word pairs - sounding suspiciously similar to startups. 
Skills learned are distinctions between stateless and stateful widgets to make dynamic or static app features; use of the command line and VS Code extension to create, write and test apps and finally, how to add widgets to change app behaviour. Produced using the guided Google CodeLabs tutorial: https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/first-flutter-app-pt1
