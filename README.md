# Flutter_projects
A record of my journey from beginner to (hopefully!) wizard of Flutter app development.
## Why Flutter?
TL;DR: Write once and it can work on browser, iOS, Android, GNU+Linux, Windows and Mac, that's why!
App development is not my primary work focus - I need it to disseminate research output to experts who are more comfortable 
with smartphones and browsers than command line and docker. Flutter can work on all of these platforms. I owe HyperPixel, Norwich, a debt of gratitude for introducing me to such a wonderful tool.

## Summary of each app:
* **01_Startup_namer** : App with a scroll-down interface for generating random word pairs - sounding suspiciously similar to startups. 
Skills learned are distinctions between stateless and stateful widgets to make dynamic or static app features; use of the command line and VS Code extension to create, write and test apps and finally, how to add widgets to change app behaviour.
